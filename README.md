# EZPZ
An easy-peasy way of starting your gamedev journey

This project is intended to work in the same vein as Unity's "Playground" toolset, which provides a set of simple, modular, and reusable scripts that work in a drag-and-drop manner.
I found Playground to be a bit lacking, and my goal is to make EZPZ more expandable and customizeable for intermediate/advanced users.
